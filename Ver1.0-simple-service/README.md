## Information about the version 1.0

```
Version 1.0
* SSH server already instaled and configured
* Creation of the service to monitor one/(or more than one) service(s) on the system
```

The project is composed by two scripts, building a 'systemd service' in order to monitor the ssh-service, ensuring that the SSH Server is always ON, avoiding interruptions of remote connections.
The service is called "noc-mon.service" and calls the script "NOC-MON.sh" .
